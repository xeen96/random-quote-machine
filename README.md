# Random Quote Generator

This is one of the projects required for certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It is part of the **Front End Development Libraries Certification** curriculum.

## Project Description

The Random Quote Generator is a React-based application that dynamically generates random quotes and their authors. Users can:

- View a new random quote at the click of a button.
- Share the current quote directly on Twitter using the "Tweet this quote!" button.

The project is designed to demonstrate proficiency with the following technologies and concepts:

- **React**: For building reusable components and managing state.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For animating elements like quotes and authors to enhance user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is accessible and visually appealing on devices of all sizes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Quote Generation**: Fetches random quotes from an API and displays them in a visually appealing way.
- **Tweet Sharing**: Prepares the quote text in a format compatible with Twitterâ€™s "Intent to Tweet" URL, allowing for seamless sharing.
- **Smooth Animations**: Uses GSAP for animations when quotes change.

## How to Use

1. Open the application.
2. Click the "New Quote" button to fetch and display a random quote.
3. Click the Twitter button to share the current quote.
